This is a script to read the Emacs -*- Mode -*- lines that can be found at the
top of many source code files.  I don't use Emacs, but a lot of source files have the lines.

I tested this out by using it on the Mozilla code base, so the cases that are
handled are what appear there.  If there are other options that you find in
other Emacs mode lines, send me an email so that I can get them added.
