This is a script to read the Emacs -*- Mode -*- lines that can be found at the
top of many source code files.  It current supports setting:

Emacs 		--> Vim equivalent
---------------------------------
Mode		 --> filetype
tab-width	 --> tabstop
indent-tabs-mode --> expandtab/noexpandtab
c-basic-offset	 --> shiftwidth

To install, simply copy emacsmode.vim an emacsmode.pl to your ~/.vim/plugin/
directory.  If you have a perl enabled Vim, you can omit the emacsmode.pl
script, since it won't ever be called.

If you install into the perl runtime directory (i.e. /usr/share/vim,) and you
don't have a perl enabled Vim, you'll have to change one line in emacsmode.vim
to point to the place where emacsmode.pl is installed.

I tested this out by using it on the Mozilla code base, so the cases that are
handled are what appear there.  If there are other options that you find in
other Emacs mode lines, send me an email so that I can get them added.

Happy Vimming!
